        My experiences range from Front-End Architecture and UI/UX Design to
        Back-End Development. I develop web applications that have an intuitive
        design, are accessible to users with disabilities, load fast and have a
        maintenable code basis.

        My tasks include taking ownership for the products I participate,
        deciding for the right technological solution for any given projects, as
        well as coaching and transfering knowledge to fellow developers.
